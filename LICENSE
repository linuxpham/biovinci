“License Key” means, collectively, the specific serial number, code, and authorization for each copy of the Licensed Software issued by BioTuring.
“License Fee” means the fee charged for the Software License.
“Update” means any official update or error correction or revision provided by BioTuring to the Software that may contain new features, functions, or enhancement.
"Machine ID” is the name that a computer uses to identify itself from the other machines on a given network.


LICENSE AND TERM.Under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Software license granted to you is non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited, and revocable. You are liable to strictly comply with the term of the license that you purchased or are granted by BioTuring.
a) The Trial License is free of charge and can be used for a period of 3 consecutive days (72 hours) from the time you request the Trial License Key. One Computer (one Machine ID) can register, activate and run the Trial License one time only. One valid verified email address can request up to 2 Trial License Keys, which shall be activated on 2 different Computers (2 different Machine IDs). After 3 consecutive days (72 hours) from the time you request the Trial License Key, the Trial License shall expire and the Software will cease to function. Any action or attempt to disable, interrupt or otherwise modify BioTuring’s system in order to extend or modify the term of the Trial License without BioTuring’s authorization is deemed to be a breach of this Agreement and is strictly prohibited.
b) The Software License shall be granted to you after you have paid the License Fee, received your valid invoice and completed all necessary registration procedures as required by BioTuring. The period of time for your Software License shall be subject to what you have registered or purchased as indicated on the invoice, and shall be calculated from the time you purchase the License. The Software License may be terminated earlier if you violate any term or condition of this Agreement. A valid License Key can be activated one time only on one Computer only. You must choose the Computer that will run the Software and install the Software on this Computer first before requesting or purchasing a license. Through this process, you agree to send the hardware configuration of your Computer to BioTuring. BioTuring shall use this information solely for the purpose of identifying your request or purchase.

UPDATE. If you receive an official Update of the Software from BioTuring, you should ensure that you have backed up all your data prior to installing the Update. You hereby agree that BioTuring shall not be liable for any change, incompatibility or loss of your data arising from, or in connection with, the Update.
ACTIVATION AND LICENSE VERIFICATION. After installation, you must activate the Software before using it for the first time. You have no right to use the Software unless it is activated. You hereby agree that BioTuring verifies your License or Trial License each time you open the Software. In this verification process, the Software will send the information about the Software License and the Computer to BioTuring. This information includes the License Key, or the Trial License Key, the version of the Software, and the hardware configuration of the computer. By installing, accessing or otherwise using the Software, you agree to the transmission of such information. Any action or attempt to disable, interrupt, bypass, circumvent, spoof or otherwise modify this transmission is forbidden.
INSPECTION. For the enforcement of BioTuring’s rights under this Agreement and applicable law, BioTuring or BioTuring’s authorized representative(s) shall have the right to inspect and audit your use of the Software, at your facilities or electronically, with or without prior written notice, to investigate any reported or apparent violation of this Agreement, or to verify that you are legally authorized by BioTuring to install, access or otherwise use the software and in compliance with the Agreement. If such inspection(s) or audit(s) prove your violation of the Agreement, then you must pay all the unpaid license fees and any reasonable costs of the inspection(s), and the license for the Software shall terminate, and the software shall cease to function on your computer(s). BioTuring or BioTuring’s representative(s) shall have the right to use and disclose the information obtained during the inspection or audit for the enforcement of BioTuring’s right under this Agreement and applicable law, or when such uses and disclosures are required by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section, or nothing in this Agreement, shall be deemed to limit any remedies that BioTuring can implement if any violation of this Agreement occurs.
